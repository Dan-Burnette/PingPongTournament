PingPongTournament
==================

MakerSquare First Hackathon Project


This was an early project done in the first few weeks at MakerSquare. We were able to get a super basic eight person 
tournament bracket going which we could click through and display basic statistics. This was done by four of us in about 
two days and was our first experience messing with ActiveRecord.
